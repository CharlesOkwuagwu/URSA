{"name":"Ursa","tagline":"Ultimate ReSt Api","body":"### Meet the bear - Ultimate ReSt Api.\r\nWelcome to the home site of the URSA project. Here you can find documentation pieces that would allow you to get started with creating your ReSTful APIs easily.\r\n\r\n### Why URSA?\r\nI've worked with several ReSTful implementations written in C# and none of tchem felt ... ReSTful. There is WCF or Web API, Nancy FX, but I had an impression that the only difference from SOAP was a nice looking Url, JSON instead of an XML and sometimes HTTP POST instead of a HTTP GET.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to treat i.e. errors the ReSTful way you had to spend some extra time implementing various extensions.\r\n\r\nFinally, all of them have nothing to do with Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATOAS - is that a shortcut, really?!?).\r\n\r\n### URSA to the rescue\r\nI decided to play a little with HYpermedia DRiven Application (HYDRA) Core Vocabulary - a promising solution for documenting ReST APIs so a client can be provided with hypermedia details telling him on what, when and how it can communicate with the server.\r\n\r\nQuickly this tiny project started to grow and became an alternate solution for the mentioned solutions when it comes to ReSTful API written in C#. While there is still plenty of work it already a working solution that could be good starting point for other developers.","google":"UA-67908406-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
