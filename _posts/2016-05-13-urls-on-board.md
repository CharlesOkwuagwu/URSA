Yeah, owned URL facility is finally up and runnig. I had a chance to finish it up and merge the url's branch with the _master_. In the last approach i was also able to add IP url class segment normalization.

I still need to consider adding case insensitive URL comparison, which is partially implemented, but not for the path - authority component only.

So far it works in general. Unfortunately, there is still plenty of work and ideas ahead and URLs became less interesting now. Let's turn a head towards hypermedia controls.
