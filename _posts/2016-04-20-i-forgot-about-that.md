title: I forgot about that

It was a great move to review the code. It came out that while I have a component that transforms multipart bodies, I forgot to have one for those X-WWW-Url-Encoded!

It took me just about a couple of hours to have it implemented and tested. I'll need to think about few use cases, but I think I'll have it up and running by today.
