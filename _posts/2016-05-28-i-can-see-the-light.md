Yep, I'm in the middle of correcting that virtual stupidity I wrote about earlier. In the meantime I've found few other puzzles missing, especially in the client code, but I'll make it. Sooner or later.

Last few weeks weren't actually very good for coding. Few bank hollidays, fully blown spring - nothing really encouriaging to spent time in front of the keyboard.

But good things happend in those few weeks - Hydra community started to acknowledge that the spec is far behind of what has been discussed. Maybe it'll hasten things and finally some of my issues will be resolved.
Maybe I'll be able to commit more of my work to that spec. We'll see.
