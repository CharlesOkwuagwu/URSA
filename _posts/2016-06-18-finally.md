title: Finally
---

It came to an end. The main reason I started writing this _blog_. There was a contest named "Let yourself noticed" (originally "Daj się Poznać").
There were about 300 projects comitted, from which URSA made to the _final_ 70. As I started URSA long before, it was a great opportunity to let the world (or Poland in this case) notice URSA (and myself in the process :)).

I didn't make it to the podium, but it was fun anyway. I just hope not to stop writing these log - it prooved useful as I don't get lost.

I'm also gonna be more active. All monsters slained, all plots resolved, world is saved - I can get back to coding.
