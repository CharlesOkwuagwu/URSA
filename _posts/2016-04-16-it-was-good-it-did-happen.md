title: It was good it did happen

I can now see that it was indeed good that I decided to review the code and cover more code with unit tests.

I found several places that actually couldn't work. I past only one third of the whole solution, but I'll keep going.

Drawback is that there are no interesting things that can happen to feed the log, but I'll try to share everething interesting that may occure.
