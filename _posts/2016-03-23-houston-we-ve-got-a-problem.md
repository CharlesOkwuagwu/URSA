O dear! I'll need to revamp my data model a bit to have all those sub-classes reflected.

I thought that having i.e. a collection class with a values range property holding an another class would make my life easier. But it didn't.

Currently I tend to move to a class description that holds it's properties and cardinality information. This will also take off this information from the properties themselves.

I'm just a bit tired of these major changes and I'm gonna have some break once I'm done with that! I just wonder when I will be able to push all my changes back to GitHub?!?
