It seems that neares path for further development is decided. Small refactorization of the client side code which will prepare it for being packaged an published.

Another step would be to review the unit tests as I didn't cover many places. This was by purpose as I have to choose between features and quality due to limited time.
But this would be a great excercise before the next step.

Which would be ... full hypermedia driven communication!

I wanted to cover as much as possible for both RDF and old-school JSON/XML based APIs. But this area is restricted for RDF only.
But a client that would discover possibilities on the fly while communicating with the server sounds ... interesting.

I'm somehow worried that it may proove a bit difficult and unpredicted for business uses, but this sounds challanging!

Than, what am I waiting for?
