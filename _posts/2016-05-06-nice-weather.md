Ahhh, that nice sun outside is just too much to spend my time with coding. Waited way to long whole winter to enjoy some sun.

Anyway, I was able to have my URL infrastructure ready and I just need to replace all references for _System.Uri_ with the new one.

I'll probably have a chance to review few more things. I know - this all prevents me from rushing into the serious topic of having fully hypermedia control driven payloads, but there are some things are important, but some other are even more important!
