I've got it up and working. Both server and client no support _hydra:Collection_ instead of other, not _Hydra_ compliant constructs.

The OWL parsing routine that I applied are not very RDFish, but seems to work for the cases I encountered. I'm pretty sure that those constructs will fail with _Hydra_console_, but we'll see.

Still I need to adjus the _XSLT_ documentation stylesheet. Oh, how much I don't want to do this. But if I want to publish everything to the demo site, I'm gonna need this feature as well.

I hope I'll have it all covered before [WolvesSummit](https://www.wolvessummit.com/) as it may be quite useful to show something working.
