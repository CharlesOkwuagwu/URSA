title: Hydra Console
---

Good thing is that I've started working on those _hydra:Collection_s.
I totaly forgot that the Hydra Console application (or the PHP's JSON-LD processor used there) is now fixed - at least Marcus - guy behind Hydra - told me so.

I'll need to check my autogenerated API documentation against it to check for compliance - there is no use of my work if it doesn't follow the spec tight enough.

It'll take some time before I'll finish this part, but this is a must as I've already reached a "point of no return" with URSA - to much of my time sits there.
