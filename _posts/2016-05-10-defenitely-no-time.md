My development suffers a little from my lack of time to spent on this. I'm so close to finish the URL infrastructure, just some more time with clients and real life tests, but it'll take few more days.

I defenitely need some rest before moving to the full hypermedia support. Actually I need to think it over on how to inject such things like operations or views manually from the controller's code into the payload!

I need to have it arranged carefuly or I'm screwed...
